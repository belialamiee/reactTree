This is a simple tree building example in my learning React
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Run this command after cloning this repo.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Notes

At present this is fairly scarce as it is a proof of concept whilst learning how to use Reacy and its components.

The Tree structure presently resides in 
`src/LeftDiv.js`
All nodes need a children node which can be as simple as `children: []`



### Todo
Add in proper styling. the current styling is very placeholder<br>
Implement the right hand div so that the chosen left hand sides contents are displayed.<br>
Move the LeftDiv/RightDiv and Title into a parent Component so they are not individually loaded.<br>
Fix Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop warnings. <br>
